To run, use `docker compose up`

The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

When opening the website, you will notice it will be blank, so go to `http://localhost:3000/admin`

Create a new collection

Upload some images add questions and give them one or more answers.

Go back to `http://localhost:3000/`

Select your collection and happy learning!

The admin route does not have a link on the main page so you can share the site with other people on the same network as you, if you want (and as we know, people tend to be curious and click on things, so to avoid others ending up changing the collections, I chose not to put it on the main page).

I'm working on setting up an admin login/password so you can make the app publicly available.
